# AyurNiti
A chatbot for assessing an individual's *Prakriti* is designed to evaluate a person's inherent constitution based on the principles of Ayurveda. This chatbot interacts with users through a series of questions that analyze various physical, mental, and emotional characteristics. The questions focus on aspects like body type, digestion, temperament, sleep patterns, and stress response.

By interpreting the user's responses, the chatbot categorizes their *prakriti* into one or more of the three primary doshas: *Vata*, *Pitta*, and *Kapha*. Each dosha corresponds to a different set of qualities, and understanding a person's dominant dosha helps in tailoring lifestyle, diet, and health recommendations.

The chatbot is designed to be user-friendly and informative, providing not just an assessment but also personalized tips and suggestions based on the user's *prakriti*. This makes it a valuable tool for individuals seeking to enhance their well-being through holistic and customized advice.
